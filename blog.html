          <p><b>var:</b>

            <b>Function-Level Scope:</b> Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are visible throughout the entire function in which they are declared. This behavior can sometimes lead to unexpected results, especially inside loops or conditional statements. <br>
            <b>Hoisting:</b> var variables are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can access and use a var variable before it's declared in the code, but it will have an initial value of undefined. <br>
            <b>Global Scope:</b> If declared outside of any function, var variables become global variables and can be accessed from anywhere in the code, which can lead to potential naming conflicts and unexpected side effects.</p>

          (3) What do you mean by REST API?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>Certainly! One unique aspect of RESTful APIs is the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources. These methods map to common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a predictable and intuitive way:
            <br>
          <b>GET:</b> Used to retrieve data from a resource. It should not have any side effects on the resource.
            <br>
          <b>POST:</b>  Used to create a new resource. It often involves sending data to the server to be processed and stored.
            <br>
          <b>PUT:</b> Used to update an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist. It typically replaces the entire resource with the new data.
            <br>
          <b>DELETE:</b>  Used to remove a resource from the server.
            
            These HTTP methods provide a uniform and consistent way to interact with resources, making RESTful APIs easy to understand and work with. It's one of the key design principles that sets REST apart from other architectural styles for building APIs.</p>
